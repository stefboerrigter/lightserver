   ===== Lightserver ======

This is a small program i use on an embedded micro-pc (Beaglebone / Raspberry) to
setup a socket and listen on a specific port. the received messages shall toggle a
gpio that is connected to an Relay that enables me to remotely control lights
via an ethernet command. The commands are send via the process.php script that run
on my private webserver. since it is only internal there are no security meassures
taken of any kind.
